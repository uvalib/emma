  Activation of item download links require you to be <%= signed_in -%> to EMMA
  (although certain non-restricted items may be freely downloadable, depending
  on the originating member repository).
  After performing a <%= search -%>, scroll to the item of interest, and click
  on the download link to initiate a download.

  </h2>

  <p>
    Because HathiTrust applies its own restrictions, item download links
    supplied to the EMMA Unified Index are actually links to the HathiTrust web
    page entry for the creative work associated with the item.
    Such pages may reference multiple copies of the same item &mdash;
    unique scans contributed by different academic partners.
  </p>

  <p>
    The actual download is performed from the hathitrust.org web page;
    this constitutes a transaction between that web site and your web browser.
    Currently, the EMMA system is not a party to this transaction;
    future work may include enhancements to help reflect this information
    within EMMA.
    For now, however, the EMMA system will not be able to track your file
    download from HathiTrust, and therefore will not know the origin of this
    item.
  </p>

<section role="region" aria-labelledby="download_ace_help">

  <h2 class="section" id="download_ace_help">
    <span class="text"><%= ace_title -%></span>

  </h2>

  <p>
    Because these items are made available to EMMA users via Internet Archive,
    see <a href="#download_internetArchive_help"><%= ia_title -%></a> below.
  </p>

</section>

<section role="region" aria-labelledby="download_internetArchive_help">

  <h2 class="section" id="download_internetArchive_help">
    <span class="text"><%= ia_title -%></span>
    <%= ia_logo %>
  </h2>

  <p>
    EMMA manages downloads from Internet Archive in two ways, depending on the
    type of file:
  </p>

  <p>
    For DAISY, Internet Archive currently only delivers encrypted content.
    In this case, the download link is a direct link to Internet Archive
    because the file itself is freely-available.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use of the DAISY content, however, will require a key as described within
    the download itself.
    Refer to IA's article on <%= ia_disability_link -%> for details.
  </p>

  <p>
    For other types (EPUB, PDF, etc.), EMMA intercedes by making a request to
    Internet Archive's facility for generating unencumbered sources
    "on-the-fly".
    Because these files are created dynamically, there may be some delay before
    the browser download dialog appears.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may see an error message:
    <%= ia_timeout %>
    This indicates that the current attempt to download was completed
    unsuccessfully.
    Retrying the download link after a few minutes, however, should result in
    the download without further delay.
  </p>

<section role="region" aria-labelledby="download_bookshare_help">

  <h2 class="section" id="download_bookshare_help">
    <span class="text"><%= bs_title -%></span>
    <%= bs_logo %>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Bookshare requires that downloads be performed by a "sponsor" on behalf of
    members with qualifying disabilities.
    Download links to Bookshare items are actually links to a Bookshare web
    page form through which the intended recipients can be indicated,
    and which performs the actual download.
  </p>

  <p>
    The actual download is performed from the bookshare.org web page;
    this constitutes a transaction between that web site and your web browser.
    Currently, the EMMA system is not a party to this transaction;
    future work may include enhancements to help reflect this information
    within EMMA.
    For now, however, the EMMA system will not be able to track your file
    download from Bookshare, and therefore will not know the origin of this
    item.

    <span class="text"><%= emma_title -%></span>

  </h2>

  <p>
    Items that are "native" to the EMMA repository
    (that is, items that have been uploaded by EMMA users and/or are otherwise
    not to be found in any of the other member repositories)
    come in two flavors (at least initially):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Items uploaded directly to EMMA by EMMA users.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bookshare items that are part of their "EMMA Collection"
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Items of the first type are delivered directly from the EMMA repository to
    a signed-in user.
  </p>

  <p>
    Items of the second type were initially used to "prime" the collection of
    items associated with EMMA.
    These items are actually Bookshare items.
    When downloaded they behave like Bookshare items as
    <a href="#download_bookshare_help">described above</a>,
    except that they are not "watermarked".
