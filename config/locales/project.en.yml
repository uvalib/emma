          The purpose of EMMA is to allow disability services professionals at
          different organizations to share accessible and remediated
          educational materials with each other.
          You may upload such materials to the EMMA repository and download
          materials deposited in the EMMA repository by your peers at other
          organizations.
          
          EMMA is intended for use by disability services professionals, their
          support staff, and librarians who help with bulk upload.
          You may use EMMA to download educational materials to give to
          qualified end users (people with documented print disabilities).
          Qualified end users are not meant to have direct access to EMMA.
          Each participating disability service organization is responsible for
          identifying qualified end users and limiting the distribution of
          materials sourced from EMMA to those users.
          
          When uploading materials to the EMMA repository, please remove
          personally identifiable information pertaining to your students and
          staff (such as watermarks or embedded metadata containing students’
          names).
          Uploads to the EMMA repository will be shared with other EMMA
          members.
          If you have added creative work to the materials (such as image
          descriptions), you agree that EMMA will apply a Creative Commons CC0
          Waiver to them.
          You can delete materials uploaded from your organization, if need be.
          If your organization terminates its EMMA membership, EMMA will still
          retain any educational materials you have uploaded unless you delete
          them before your membership ends.
          
          When your organization is enrolled in EMMA, one person will be
          designated as the local Manager for your organization.
          The Manager is responsible for creating additional accounts for other
          users at your organization.
          The Manager is also responsible for deactivating those users’
          accounts if they leave the organization or change job
          responsibilities and are no longer involved in providing accessible
          educational materials for qualified end users.
          If you need assistance managing user accounts, or if you need to
          reassign the Manager role at your organization, please contact us at
          %{contact_email}.
          
          EMMA is supported by staff of the University of Virginia Library.
          If you encounter problems while using EMMA, please send us a help
          request at %{help_email}.
          We will do our best to respond as soon as possible.

          |-
          An account has been created for you, and an organization has been
          created in EMMA for your school.
          As the person who initiated EMMA enrollment for your organization,
          you have been made the local manager of EMMA accounts for your
          school. 

          You can now go to emma.lib.virginia.edu and use the email address to
          which this message has been sent to log in.
          First, try using Shibboleth to log in: you will either find your
          school on the InCommon dropdown list or you won't.
          If you do find your institution there, choose it and then give it
          your individual and literal network ID, not an alias or group mailbox
          address.
          If Shibboleth login succeeds, that's the best outcome in terms of
          ease of use in the future.
          If it fails after you found your school on the list, please let me
          know.
          If your institution was not on the InCommon list in the first place,
          or if your shibboleth attempt failed, then choose the other option,
          EMMA local sign-in, and choose "Forgot your password" which will ask
          you for your email address.
          Please give the same address that you used in requesting enrollment
          (or the corrected version, if I asked you for one).
          If you are not successful, drop me a line at unsworth@virginia.edu.  

          Once logged in as a Manager, you can now add accounts for other users
          at your organization.
          Instructions for signing into EMMA and creating additional accounts
          are in the attached PDF help document, pages 4-7 which you can share.
          Additional help documents are available as downloadable PDFs on the
          EMMA Help Topics page, but for the users you create you will already
          know which option they should choose--shibboleth or EMMA local
          sign-in, so you can instruct them accordingly.
          If you are using Shibboleth, be sure to remind the users you create
          to give you their literal email address, not an alias or group
          mailbox name.  

          Feel free to sign into EMMA and start exploring (and uploading!).
          The search feature lets you search for accessible, machine readable,
          and remediated resources from the Internet Archive, the Accessible
          Content E-Portal in Canada, and the EMMA Repository itself, which is
          where your uploads will go.  

          Zoom demos of EMMA will be scheduled in the near future, but EMMA is
          still under development, so we want to advise you of a few known
          issues you might bump into:

          Search and Download: Known Issues

          OpenAlex is listed as a searchable repository, but is not actually
          available yet.
          OpenAlex indexing is a “coming soon” feature for this summer.
          This will add about 40M URLS for open-access journal articles, books,
          and other materials that EMMA users will be able to download directly
          from our search results. 

          DAISY downloads from Internet Archive are not working, probably due
          to factors outside our direct control.
          We have reached out to our friends at the Internet Archive for
          assistance.
          We'll update via the emma-users email list. 

          Users may run into references to our former repository partners
          HathiTrust and Bookshare scattered through the interface and
          documentation:
          they're still friends, but they're not in the current index.  

          Upload: Known Issues

          All uploads should be manually set to “source repository” = EMMA,
          regardless of where they were actually sourced from.
          The confusing situation reflects an earlier stage in EMMA's
          development that will eventually become invisible.

          If the bulk upload manifest does not allow you to enter data, refresh
          your browser page.

          The status indicators on the left side of the bulk upload manifest
          are not always appearing as they should, and may falsely indicate
          that a line in the manifest is not ready for upload.
          If you think you have supplied the minimum necessary metadata along
          with the files for upload, try saving and submitting the manifest.

          Bug reporting: 

          If you run into difficulties not listed above, and not addressed by
          the documentation on  the Help page, please email us at
          %{help_email}.
          We are a small crew, working very hard to open EMMA for new users,
          and we will respond as soon as we can.

          Details of Zoom demos and other announcements will be sent out to the
          emma-users email list.
          You should already be subscribed to that list, and in the future we
          will automate that as part of new account creation, but meanwhile,
          when you create accounts for staff at your institution, please ask
          them to subscribe here:
