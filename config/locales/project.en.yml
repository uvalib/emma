          The purpose of EMMA is to allow disability services professionals at
          different organizations to share accessible and remediated
          educational materials with each other.
          You may upload such materials to the EMMA repository and download
          materials deposited in the EMMA repository by your peers at other
          organizations.
          
          EMMA is intended for use by disability services professionals, their
          support staff, and librarians who help with bulk upload.
          You may use EMMA to download educational materials to give to
          qualified end users (people with documented print disabilities).
          Qualified end users are not meant to have direct access to EMMA.
          Each participating disability service organization is responsible for
          identifying qualified end users and limiting the distribution of
          materials sourced from EMMA to those users.
          
          When uploading materials to the EMMA repository, please remove
          personally identifiable information pertaining to your students and
          staff (such as watermarks or embedded metadata containing students’
          names).
          Uploads to the EMMA repository will be shared with other EMMA
          members.
          If you have added creative work to the materials (such as image
          descriptions), you agree that EMMA will apply a Creative Commons CC0
          Waiver to them.
          You can delete materials uploaded from your organization, if need be.
          If your organization terminates its EMMA membership, EMMA will still
          retain any educational materials you have uploaded unless you delete
          them before your membership ends.
          
          When your organization is enrolled in EMMA, one person will be
          designated as the local Manager for your organization.
          The Manager is responsible for creating additional accounts for other
          users at your organization.
          The Manager is also responsible for deactivating those users’
          accounts if they leave the organization or change job
          responsibilities and are no longer involved in providing accessible
          educational materials for qualified end users.
          If you need assistance managing user accounts, or if you need to
          reassign the Manager role at your organization, please contact us at
          %{contact_email} .
          
          EMMA is supported by staff of the University of Virginia Library.
          If you encounter problems while using EMMA, please send us a help
          request at %{help_email} .
          We will do our best to respond within normal working hours.
