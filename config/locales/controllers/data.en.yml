          <p>
            This page only reports on data fields which are actually used in
            submissions.
            To discover invalid (ignored) data fields that may have crept into
            the submission data, use the URL parameter "all=true".
          </p>
          <p>
            To create a link which goes directly to the values of a particular
            field, use the field name as a URL fragment, e.g.:
            <a href="/data/counts#dc_title">/data/counts#dc_title</a>.
          </p>
