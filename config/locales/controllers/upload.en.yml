          An EMMA entry consists of three parts: (1) a record in the EMMA
          database, (2) an associated file in cloud storage, and (3) a matching
          entry in the Unified Index.  If an item identifier can be found in
          the EMMA database then all three parts can be removed.  However, if
          the checkbox above is checked, then submission IDs which are not
          found in EMMA can still be removed from the index.
