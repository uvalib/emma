# Simulation Code

This directory holds overrides which are mixed in when experimenting with
simulated behavior in desktop development.

_**None of this code is active in a normal deployment**_
and may end up being removed at some point if there's no clear future benefit.

These overrides are segregated from the normal code to make them easier to
hide from Yard via [.yardopts](./.yardopts) when generating documentation.

## Directory Structure

The convention established here is that the structure of this directory mirrors
the structure of the [app](./app) directory.
