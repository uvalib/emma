> Education Materials Made Accessible

The [EMMA application][emma] supports academic DSOs (disability services
offices) by providing an interface to search for accessibility-remediated
content offered by member repositories Bookshare, Internet Archive, and
HathiTrust, as well as remediated materials uploaded directly to the EMMA
repository by participating DSOs.
