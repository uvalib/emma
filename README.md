> Education Materials Made Accessible

The [EMMA application][emma] supports academic DSOs (disability services
offices) by providing an interface to search for accessibility-remediated
content offered by partner repositories
[Accessible Content E-Portal][ace] (ACE) and [Internet Archive][ia],
as well as remediated materials uploaded directly
to the EMMA repository by participating DSOs.
