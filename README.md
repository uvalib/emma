# EMMA
> Education Materials Made Accessible

The [EMMA application][emma] supports academic DSOs (disability services
offices) by providing an interface to search for accessibility-remediated
content offered by member repositories
[Accessible Content E-Portal][ace] (ACE),
[Bookshare][bs],
[Internet Archive][ia], and
[HathiTrust][ht],
as well as remediated materials uploaded directly to the EMMA
repository by participating DSOs.
